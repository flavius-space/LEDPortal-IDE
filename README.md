![LX Studio](https://raw.github.com/heronarts/LXStudio/master/assets/screenshot.jpg)

[LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation — a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

### Getting Started

LX Studio runs using the Processing 3 framework. This version of the project directly embeds those dependencies and may be run from within a Java IDE,
for larger projects in which the Processing IDE is insufficient. The example project here can be run either using the full Processing-based UI,
or alternatively in a headless CLI-only mode.

To get started, clone this repository and import the project into an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ. Configuration files for both are readily
available in the repository.

Documentation is available on the [LX Studio Wiki &rarr;](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio/wiki)

Consult the [LX Studio API reference &rarr;](http://lx.studio/api/)

### Contact and Collaboration

Building a big cool project? I'm probably interested in hearing about it! Want to solicit some help, request new framework features, or just ask a random question? Open an issue on the project or drop me a line: mark@heronarts.com
